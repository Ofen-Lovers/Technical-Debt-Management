##Overview
This program calculates the monthly salary deductions for an employee, which include SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, and Tax, and computes the net salary after deductions. The program also handles various exemption rules for employees earning below certain thresholds and validates the input to ensure no negative or invalid salary values are entered.
